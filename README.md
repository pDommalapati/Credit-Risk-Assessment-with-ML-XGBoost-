**What this project is**

I partnered with a finance team to rethink how we classify clients for credit decisions. 
By blending data cleaning, smart feature engineering, and an XGBoost model, 
we transformed a 36,000-record dataset into a reliable risk-scoring engine.

**My role & approach**

I led data prep—converting raw fields like birth dates into ages, handling missing values, 
and applying SMOTE to balance “good” vs. “bad” client classes. Then I built and tuned an XGBoost classifier, 
using SHAP values to spotlight the top factors driving risk.

**Key achievements**

Boosted F1 score from 51% to 86% by balancing the dataset and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Identified payment history and employment stability as the strongest predictors via SHAP analysis.
Designed a phased rollout plan for an automated approval system and dynamic interest rates.

**Impact & takeaways**

This solution cut manual review time by an estimated 40%, sharpened our risk insights, 
and laid the groundwork for real-time credit decisions. I learned how to turn complex model outputs into 
clear business actions and build trust across stakeholders.
